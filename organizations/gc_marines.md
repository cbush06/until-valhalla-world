# GC Marines

The Global Coalition Marines was/is the GC's answer to the need for a space-faring military force. Needing maximum agility, the GC opted for a combined Naval and Groud Force. The Marines would answer both needs.

## Initial Fleet

Having served as a transit station between Earth and Mars for the last 15 years, the lunar station Neuer Anfang (New Beginning in German) was the obvious place to build Earth's first space navy. The GC contracted with every existing space engineering firm available to start retrofitting the station as a ship yard. Three months after first contact (May 20, 2120), construction completed on the first of 3 building berths. By the end of July, all three were complete and construction began on the first 3 space destroyers.

## Training Facilities

Low-G and Zero-G training facilities were constructed on the Lunar Surface. The installation was named Mao Jian (spear tip) by its Chinese benefactors.
