# Global Coalition

The Global Coalition is an intergovernmental organization made up of the world's superpowers and 30 other nation-states. It evolved out of the United Nations as a body to oversee and govern Earth's military and political response to first contact with the Kyron, manage extraterrestrial relations, and move the human species into the space-faring age.

Following the identification of what we now know was the Kyron's ship, the GC oversaw the build-up of global military forces into the GC Marines. The GC member states poured their collective funds into research and development of long-distance space travel, faster than light engines, new weaponry, advanced linguistics, super lightspeed communication, and planetary defense systems.

## GC University System

Such a rapid build-up of technology and skilled workers required a planet-sized effort. Earth needed a space-faring navy, and fast. To train a large enough workforce, the GC established 10 international universities, two each in Germany, the UK, China, Russia, and the US. Curriculum included many traditional trade skills (sheet metal, welding, pipe fitting, etc.), but in zero G and zero oxygen environments. Non-traditional skills included small-factor fusion reactors, directed energy weapons, and Alcubierre drives.

Although the impending first contact with an extraterrestrial race was the nominal reason for these efforts, giving the masses of basic allowance recipients hope in the form of jobs and futures was possibly an even greater benefit.

## GC Military Schools

Joint political efforts are challenging enough without involving globally coordinated military action. To answer this demand, the GC Marines established one military school in each of the five permanent member nations. Recruits were trained in zero-G warfare, space travel, and, most importantly, operating jointly with units combined of marines from around the world.

## GC Recruiting Efforts

With three years to prepare a response to the impending threat, the World had to band together and make some very tough decisions. Part of these were the draft of many of Earth's greatest minds to develop technology for space travel and space warfare, develop curriculum and training for the workforce and military recruits, and prepare for first contact.

Beyond our political and martial responses, other important questions faced humanity:

* How would this meeting redefine our perspective on the universe and life itself?
* Would the public be able to cope with the implications of intelligent life beyond our own infintesimal corner of existence?
* What could Earth hope to gain from the encounter?
