## Plot

The year is 2153. Reginald "Reggie" Lunsford is a rebellious youth given one last chance to avoid prison, join the Global Coalition Marines. The price is leaving his true love behind, the brilliant and beautiful Abigail "Abbi" Phillips.

Even more, Reggie hoped that by excelling, he could honor his father's memory, become worthy of the woman he loved, and leave his past in the past.

His father's memory and the opportunity to prove himself worthy of Abbi demanded such a committment. There was only one choice to be made, Ranger.
