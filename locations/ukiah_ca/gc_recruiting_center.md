# GC Recruiting Center

A small, open office with several desks abutted to the left and right walls. A single, uniformed GC Marine is seated at a desk in the far back, right corner. As you approach him, you can read "GANCI" on his name tape.

The front door leading out in front of the strip mall is covered in several stickers puporting great and exciting careers that will allow you to see the world and beyond.
